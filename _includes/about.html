                    <p>HBaseCon (founded in 2012) is the premier conference for the <a href="https://hbase.apache.org">Apache HBase</a>
                     communityâ€”including committers/contributors, developers, operators, learners, and users (including some of those
                     managing the largest deployments in the world). If you run Apache HBase in production or aspire to do so, HBaseCon
                     has no substitute!</p>

                    <p>This year, HBaseCon will take place on the Monday of the
                    <a href="https://dataworkssummit.com/san-jose-2018/">DataWorks Summit San Jose 2018</a> at the
                    <a href="https://www.sanjose.org/convention-center">San Jose Convention Center</a>.
                    Of note, PhoenixCon will be held in the same venue on the same day. We will make it so that attendees will be
                    able to pass freely between the two events. As the DataWorks Summit is happening this same week, attendees
                    are encouraged to consider attending all events!</p>

                    <p><a href="https://hbase.apache.org">Apache HBase</a> is a native distributed data store for the Apache Hadoop
                     ecosystem. Its community works independently within the ASF to provide their respective software
